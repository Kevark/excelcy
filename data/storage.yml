# this is the standardised data structure for ExcelCy for data integration.
data:
  # this is main configuration for the training.
  config:
    # the initial SpaCy data model to begin with. Described in https://spacy.io/models/
    base: en_core_web_sm
    # The absolute/relative path to save the SpaCy data model after training.
    # It is possible to use this to read existing data model and training on top existing one.
    #
    # Example:
    # 1. /data/test-data: Value is absolute path, ExcelCy will automatically ensure "/data" exists
    # 2. test-data: Value is relative, it is always relative to this file directory path.
    # 3. [tmp]/test-data: Value contains [tmp], it always be replaced by either env variable EXCELCY_TEMP_PATH or
    #                     python tempfile.gettempdir() output
